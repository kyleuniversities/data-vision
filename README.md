# Data Vision

The Data Vision application is a simple JavaScript fullstack application that provides visualization for K-Means Clusters. It consists of ReactJS for the frontend and ExpressJS for the backend.  Users can generate clusters points and visualize the effects of the K-Means Clustering algorithm performed on those points.

# Technologies Utilized

Unlike my other projects, I made an effort to keep light on technologies utilized. For this project, I wanted to focus more on pure JavaScript, React, and Express. The technologies I utilized include:

- **JavaScript React:** I invoked a JavaScript React frontend for the app.
- **Express JS:** I deployed a node server for the backend using Express JS.
- **Canvas with React:** During this project, I learned how to utilize using the canvas element with React

# Speed and Ease

I will be completely honest, I was able to make this project in under 12 hours. All while learning about new technologies like the JavaScript canvas, and keeping the code neatly organized. Although this project was smaller scale compared to some of my other works, like QuizTube, I felt that several aspects made it easy for me to develop this application.

- **Experience in Coding:** Since I have coded in Java for over 7 years, I have gotten used to various coding patterns that have helped me out plenty for ease of development.
- **Experience in JavaScript:** In recent months, I have been an avid coder in JavaScript / TypeScript and have been able to pick a style that helps me code efficiently
- **Other Similar Projects:** Since I have coded a lot in JavaScript, I have similar projects like QuizTube and this website, which I was able to use to help speed up the development of this app
- **Drawing Projects in the Past:** Several years ago, in my avid Java coding, I have made multiple graphing apps from first principles, which helped me easily make this app.
- **Experience in K-Means Clustering:** In San Francisco State University I worked on a project where I made my own variant of K-Means Clustering from scratch. Therefore, I am familiar with its processes.
- **Good Code Organization:** Counterintuitively, it helped me more when I commented and organized my code in while developing this app, rather than trying to skip it for speed
- **Helper Classes Architecture:** In Java, I like to make Helper classes, which act as services. In this project, I made no real "Helper Classes", but I was able to use that architecture to modularize helper functions, making development easier.

## Release

In case I decide to expand this app in the future, I will mark this point in development with a release.
